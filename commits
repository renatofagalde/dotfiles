## Additional Context for "chore"

The `chore` type is particularly useful for:

- **Initial project setup** (like your example)
- **Dependency updates**
- **Configuration changes** not directly related to features
- **Maintenance tasks** like cleaning up code
- **Tooling updates** that don't affect production code

For initial commits specifically, `chore` is appropriate as you're setting up the foundational structure of your project before adding specific features or functionality.
